      <h3>So you want to hare a ZigZag trail?</h3>
      <p>
        As of the time of this writing, I've hared around 25 trails. This is my attempt to pass on my "knowledge" and establish some of the "rules" for the kennel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Haring a trail is actually easy, and it's really fun. You don't have to be an elite runner or a super-experienced hasher. Anybody can hare a trail.
      </p>

      <h3>Marks</h3>
      <p>
        Typically I hare ZigZag trails in flour. It's cheap, fast and non-toxic. Many kennels dye their flour with carpenter's chalk, but carpenter's chalk is toxic, so I don't recommend using it.
        Kool-aid or <a href="https://www.discountschoolsupply.com/Product/ProductDetail.aspx?domainredirect=true&product=24267">powdered tempera paint</a> are good alternatives. If there is snow, you'll definitely want some pigment in there.
      </p>

      <p>
        First blob of flour = On one! Is pack going the right way? Probably not!<br/>
        Second blob of flour = On two! Is pack going the right way? Maybe?<br/>
        Third blob of flour = On On! Pack is almost certainly going the right way!
      </p>

      <p>
        Three blobs of flour in a triangle shape is a check. Trail can go in any one of 369 directions. Why 369? Because 3 69s are better than 1!
      </p>

      <p>
        The letter S in a circle indicates a song check. This functions like a regular check, but pack is required to stop and sing a song before finding trail.
      </p>

      <p>
        Is it Homer Simpson's eyes and mouth? Nope! It's a tit check and a dick check! If someone doesn't have the anatomy pictured, they have to stop and wait to be freed.<br/>
        If they do have the anatomy in the picture, they can either set the pack free by showing it off, or go find trail.*
        <div style={{textAlign: 'right'}}>
          <small>* Don't do anything you aren't comfortable with, and don't make others uncomfortable.</small>
        </div>
      </p>

      <p>
        The letters BN and BC indicate "Beer Near" and "Beer Check" respectively. The final stop on trail is marked with "On In".<br/>
        If you are laying a shot check, SN and SC work to mark it.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's it for ZZH3 marks. If you want to bring other marks on trail, make sure you communicate to whoever is doing chalk talk.
      </p>

      <h3>"Rules"</h3>

      <p>
        My aim for this kennel is to keep the rules to a minimum. But here they are:

        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Respect!</b><br/>
            Hashing is a fun, drunken and slightly sexy time. It can only be this way as long as everybody is respectful.<br/>
            This means that if someone doesn't want to partake in an aspect of trail, that's ok! Anatomy checks are optional, drinking is optional, attending is optional!
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Distance!</b><br/>
            Trails should average between 3-5 miles with 1.5 miles between beer checks. You can do shorter, but if you are going to hare a longer trail, please disclose it in your trail announcement.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>No nasty suprises!</b><br/>
            On that same note, pleasant surprises are welcome, but unpleasant surprises should be disclosed in advance.<br/>
            Pleasant surprises:
            <ul>
              <li>Unexpected giveaways</li>
              <li>Shot checks</li>
              <li>Joints</li>
              <li>Etc.</li>
            </ul>

            Unpleasant surprises:
            <ul>
              <li>Glitter a.k.a. glerpes</li>
              <li>Marks that nobody knows the meaning of</li>
              <li>Rain</li>
              <li>No beer</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Respect!</b>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h3>Hare responsibilities</h3>
      <p>
        As a hare, you are responsible for the following:
        <ol>
          <li>Scouting trail in advance</li>
          <li>Procuring beer</li>
          <li>Finding a bag car (or laying a trail that doesn't require one)</li>
          <li>Announcing / promoting your trail</li>
          <li>Having your shit together to start on time</li>
          <li>Finding an on-in</li>
        </ol>

        If this seems like a lot, consider finding someone more experienced to cohare with you.
